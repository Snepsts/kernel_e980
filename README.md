This is a kernel made from CM11 gproj. A special thank you to the CM team.
Much of the code used is from Faux's mako kernel. A big thank you to him for his Intelli-Plug/Intelli-Thermal and all of his other code and implementations.

F240 USERS:
I am currently working on the F240 Kernel. Thank you for your patience.
If you wish to follow this kenrel, my project is on XDA under the Original Android Development section in LG Optimus G Pro device fourms.
The aim of this kernel is to provide a better user experience to the large number of Cyanogenmod users on the LGOGP. This includes: Potentially better battery life, higher performance, and better responsiveness.
A current known issue is the MAC address changing randomly. I will attempt to fix that asap. But first, I obviously need to learn more about it.
This is my first kernel (or really anything involving code), so please bear with me. :)
